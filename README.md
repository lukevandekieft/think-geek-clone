# _Think Geek Site Clone_

#### _A clone of everyone's favorite novelty shop, 10/19/18_

#### By _**Luke Vandekieft**_

## Description

_What's better than yet another novelty mug gift? A novelty mug gift shaped like a Koopa shell! Think Geek is your one-stop gift shop for that special someone who you kind-of know. You may not know what you coworker **needs** but you can say with certainty what they **want**, and that thing is a snack bowl shaped like Chewbacca._

_In cloning this site I'm not only paying homage to my go-to Christmas shopping hub but also testing out my chops with Angular & Firebase. Different site components will be displayed in separate components and the final product will be available to view on a site other than GH Pages. If you have any suggestions or commentary on how my use of these tools could be improved I'm all ears!_
